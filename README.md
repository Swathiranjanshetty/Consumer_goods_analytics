# Consumer_goods_analytics -- MySQL
In this project, I solved 10 business requests using SQL, analyzing sales and customer data to uncover key insights, such as top-performing products and fast-growing regions. I presented actionable recommendations for decision-makers, refining both my technical skills and my ability to communicate insights effectively to executive management.

# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and SQL queries used for the Consumer Goods domain part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. In this project, I will be working with a dataset related to consumer goods. The goal is to answer ten specific ad hoc requests using SQL queries. The data used in this project belongs to "AtliQ Hardwares", a leading hardware company specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers with a global reach.
